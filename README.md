# FlyingFlip Studios, LLC. Platform Docker Container
### Michael R. Bagnall: <mbagnall@flyingflip.com>

This container is a standard Linux, Apache and PHP container designed to work with a separate database container for the purposes of running enterprise, production web sites or for developing web sites on your local computer. It is compiled to support Intel/AMD64 and Apple Silicon processors.

The best way to configure the container is through a `docker-compose.yml` document where volumes and environmental varaibles can be easily laid out and documented. Using environment variables, you can specify the version of PHP you wish to use as well as many configuration options for PHP and Apache. You can also use the optional `.mounts` file to define symlink mountpoints as part of your deployment to NAS or other external file hosting services as a way to keep assets in their own location and easily referenceable by all containers in your cluster.

### Example docker-compose.yml file
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  webapp:
    image: flyingflip/linux:16
    container_name: webapp
     # Volumes specify where our files are within the container. In this example, the directory where
     # the docker-compose.yml is located happens to also be the folder where the web document root folder is.
     # As such, we will mount it to a common http endpoint at /var/www/html and tell Apache via our 
     # environment variables where to look for our web folder.
    volumes:
      - ./:/var/www/html
    environment:
      # We need to tell Apache where to find the document root. Based on the volumnes configuration, it is
      # in a folder called "web" in the current directory. If it were in one called "docroot" it would be
      # listed as /var/www/html/docroot
      DOCROOT: /var/www/html/web 
      # Specify the version of PHP we wish to use. Available options are PHP 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3
      PHP_VERSION: php8.1
      # Other environment variable settings detailed below can go in this space as well.
    ports:
      # Always map port 80 and 443. If you use nginx for your proxy, proxy to port 443 using https. The container
      # contains the self signed certs to make secure communication happen on the intranet level, giving you end
      # to end encryption on all of your network traffic.
      - "8097:80"

The display of errors which occur during PHP's startup sequence are handled separately from display_errors.

**PHP_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME**  
_Default Value: 300_  
Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds. A value of 0 disables the limit.

**PHP_MAX_INPUT_TIME**

Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data. A value of -1 disables the limit.

**PHP_MAX_INPUT_VARS**  
_Default Value: 1000_  
How many GET/POST/COOKIE input variables may be accepted.

**PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT**  
_Default Value: 386M_  
Maximum amount of memory a script may consume.

**PHP_POST_MAX_SIZE**
